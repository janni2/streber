* use this file for translating streber into new languages
*
* Some hints:
*
* - This file should be edited with a utf8 capable editor.
* - Insert the translation into the '' .
* - Avoid...
*   - quotes inside strings
*   - linebreaks inside strings
* - Characters behind the pipe ('|') are just for clarifying the context.
*   Do not translate them!
* - Rename this file into "??.inc" where as "??" being the apache-shortcut of the language (like "en").
* - Add the language definition to "conf/conf.inc" (search for $g_languages)
*
* - With each new version of streber, there will be a "??.inc.changes" file with new phrases that needs
*   to be translated. Copy and paste the contense of those files into the language-files.
* - run "perl scanLanguages.pl" from this directory to check for completeness.
